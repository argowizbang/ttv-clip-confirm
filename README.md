# TTV Clip Confirm

TTV Clip Confirm adds a confirmation popup when using the "Clip" function on a stream (live or VOD) in an attempt to help cut down on accidental clips being made due to misclicks, etc. Clicking the "Clip" button (or using the `Alt` [`⌥` on Mac] + `X` hotkey that Twitch suggests) will pop up a small confirmation window asking you to confirm that you actually want to make a clip. If you do not click the button to confirm, no clip is made. Holding `Ctrl` (`⌘` on Mac) + `Shift` when attempting to make a clip will bypass the confirmation popup entirely (in other words, holding the override hotkeys will temporarily fallback to the default Twitch clip behavior).

**TTV Clip Confirm** *should* be fully compatible with [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) and [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/), though that can't always be guaranteed.
